phase1: code can be found at phase1/code/wrapper.py
phase2: code is a single notebook file : HW0Phase1AndPhase2Notebook.ipynb

Please note:
1.Phase1 and Phase2 are seprate files, phase1 is a .py file and phase2 is .ipynb file; due to the need for running on a GPU, phase2 is a notebook written using google colab
2. Please run phase2 on GPU.
3. The code is written in Python 3
4. The phase1 part of the starter code in jupyter notebook is deleted to skip confusion.
5. HW0Phase1AndPhase2Notebook.ipynb file is outside th directory, please run it there, since we have utilised functions to select and change directories in the code.

# Edge Detection in Computer Vision

## Introduction 
Edge detection is the process of identifying sharp changes in image intensity to capture object boundaries. Edge detecion is the basis for object detection and image processing. 

## Methods for Edge Detection
- **Gradient-Based Methods**: Detecting edges by examining the maximum and minimum of the first derivative of the image. 
- **Second Derivative Methods**: Using the seconf derivative. eg:- Laplacian method

## Edge Detection Algorithms
- **Sobel Operator**
- **Canny Edge Detector**
- **Prewitt OPerator**
- **Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)**
- **Roberts Cross Operator**


## Applications of Edge Detection
1. Image Segmentation
2. Object Detection
3. Feature Extraction
